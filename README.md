# hEsyt1-spinal-and-systemic-administration
Analysis scripts for locomotion, cognitive performance, weight development, and virus spread from results of intraspinal and systemic hEsyt1 administration.

This repository contains the code for the analysis of behavioral data from gait analysis of wt, En1cre, SOD1, and SOD1En1cre mice injected intraspinally with a AAV serotype 8 virus with hEsyt1 with the aim of amelorating the motor phenotype observed in the SOD1 mice model of ALS.

The lateral analysis script is used for analyzing angles of foot, ankle, knee and hip for assessing hyperflexion of the limbs. The ventral analysis script is used for analyzing changes in the gait parameters of average speed, peak acceleration, step frequency (cadence) and stride length. Weight support is for analyzing ability to support body weight. These scripts apply to both intraspinal and systemic injection experiments.

For systemic injections, this repository contains scripts for analysis of weight development, mCherry viral spread, and cognitive performance as well.

Data will be uploaded when the paper has been published.
