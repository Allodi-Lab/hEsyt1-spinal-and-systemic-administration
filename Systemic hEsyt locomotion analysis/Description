This folder contains code for locomotion analysis of experiments using systemic administration of hEsyt1

#Lateral analysis.Rmd
The lateral locomotion analysis.Rmd file holds analysis for locomotion kinematics, with the main variables of interest being hip_ang,	knee_ang,	ankle_ang, and	foot_ang, reflecting the angle for the hip, knee, ankle and foot joints, respectively.
For each video the mouse number and timepoint is parsed. From this information, genotype is assigned. The code contains information on which mouse numnber belongs to which genotype group.

In the script, angles for the different joints are compared across wildtype, en1cre, SOD1, and SOD1en1cre animals using one-way ANOVA at postnatalday 112.

#Ventral analysis.Rmd
The Ventral locomotion analysis.Rmd fileholds analysis for gait, with the main variables being Avg.Speed,	PeakAcc., MeanCadence and MeanStride, reflecting speed, acceleration, step frequency and stride length, respectively. Mean cadence and stride  are calculated based on averaging cadence for each of the 4 legs of the mouse, and likewise for stride.
For each video the mouse number and timepoint is parsed. From this information, genotype is assigned. The code contains information on which mouse numnber belongs to which genotype group.

In the script, speed, acceleration, cadence and stride are compared across wildtype, en1cre, SOD1, and SOD1en1cre animals using one-way ANOVA at postnatalday 112 and longitudinal analysis across timepoints using two-way ANOVA.
#Weight support algorithm.ipynp and WS_Analysis.Rmd
The Weight support algorithm.ipynp document holds the analysis pipeline for calculating the weight support measure, as described in the paper, based on x and y coordinates from locomotion videos analyzed in DeepLabcut. In the paper the equation is written up as where a higher pixel y-value reflects a point closer to the top of a video frame. As the videos are considered as matrices, a higher y-value reflects a vlue closer to the bottom of the frame, thus the equation is inverted in the script. Thus a higher tb_ratio value indicates the mouse keeps its tailbase closer to the floor, which for most people is counter-intuitive. In order to make the statistical analysis intuitive, the mean tailbase ratio is inverted in the first lines of the WS_analysis.Rmd script, which subsequently uses the video name to parse mouse, timepoint and genotype and compare genotype performance in mean tailbase height at p112 using ANOVA
To use the .ipynb document, the step count from ventral videos must be combined with the files holding the x and y coordinates for the videos. These values are extracted using the Num_steps script.Rmd. The resulting file produced by that script can be used in the .ipymb script. The weight support ability is analyzed in WS_Analysis.Rmd at p112 using ANOVA. 
Data on mouse number, timepoint and genotype is likewise as the other files, parsed from the file name.
